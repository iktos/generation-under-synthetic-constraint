    Prediction of machine learned retrosynthetic accessibility score
    The RAScore is calculated based on the predictions made on 200,000 compounds sampled from ChEMBL.
    The compounds were subjected to retrosynthetic analysis using a CASP tool (AiZynthfinder) and output used as labels to train a binary classifier.

    If the compounds are ChEMBL like use the RAscore models.
